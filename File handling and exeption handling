python

        filename = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")

        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # Modify content (example: convert to uppercase)
        modified_content = content.upper()
        
        # Write to a new file
        new_filename = "modified_" + filename
        with open(new_filename, 'w') as new_file:
            new_file.write(modified_content)
        
        print(f"Modified content written to: {new_filename}")
